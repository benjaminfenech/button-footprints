# Button-Footprints  
Various PCB footprints for silicone/carbon dome buttons in KiCad mod format.  

### Measurements  

For all measurements I'm using standard digital calipers to measure the pads on their original boards.   

GBC Start/Select:  
 - Individual square pads are 1.75 x 1.75mm  
 - Distance of 0.35mm between each square pad  
 - Distance of 0.65mm between 2x2 sets of pads

If importing the whole library:

If importing individual footprints:  

Create a library if you haven't already:
